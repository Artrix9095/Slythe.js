# Getting started

Before we can get started coding our bot we are going to need a couple things

## Programs

### Node.js

First off, we need to install nodejs, it is the programming language we are going to be using to code our bot

Install nodejs [here](https://nodejs.org/en/), for the best results, I suggest the **current** release over the LTS release for the most up to date stuff.

To check if you have installed nodejs, open a terminal or command prompt and type in

```bash
$ node -v
```

:::tip

For the best results, make sure you're nodejs version is **higher** than 16

### IDE

Although you can just use notepad, I would highly recommend installing an [IDE](https://www.codecademy.com/article/what-is-an-ide)

Some good ones are

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) **Recommended**
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) _deprecated_
- [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
